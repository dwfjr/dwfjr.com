## Introduction

Welcome! If you're here then you've either likely either met me in person, or someone has recommended you reach out to me. If neither of these apply to you then let me say:\
Howdy! It's nice to e-meet you!\
My name is Dennis Fischer Jr. and I am fascinated by technology. Most of all, I enjoy helping others (you) find the best use of technology in life, in a way that is best fit to let you use it to its peak potential, increase your productivity, and most of all;\
**Protect your independence and freedom, not only from other people but from technology and its addicting design itself.**\
It's an endless journey, one I still feel I'm just starting out on, but the thrill of helping others find the path is quite enjoyable.

## Where I stand

I want to help you find and create your technological independence and freedom, and that starts right here at www.dwfjr.com. \
This is my personal website that contains everything from resources I think would be helpful tools to you, how to get in touch with me, and my background and digital resume.\
You, are my guest, and my goal is to treat you like a guest. With this in mind I want to treat your data the same way I would want mine to be treated. That's why I'm building this website this way, from scratch and publicly on GitHub, there are no built in analytical tools like Google that many hosting platforms like WordPress have built in. This entire site is a tool for you to find new information, and reach out to me if you have questions or are interested in learning more about how I can help you build your own tailored digital lifestyle.

## Where are you?

You are at the landing page for my site. My hope is that it will change and grow quickly as I build out what I am doing here. For now, it's simple and to the point as I'm learning about what you, my guest, needs; and how I can best serve you. Below you will find links to each of the active pages until I can build a normal menu (a trickier task than I imagined).\
Please do not hesitate to reach out with questions or suggestions, more information can currently be found on the [security](https://github.com/dwfjr/dwfjr.com/security/policy) page or the [contact](/contact) page.

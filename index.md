## Introduction

Welcome! If you here then you've likely either met me in person, or someone who has recommended you reach out to me. If neither of their apply to you then let me say, Howdy! It's nice to e-meet you!
My name is Dennis Fischer Jr. and I am fascinated by technology. Most of all I enjoy helping others (you) find the best use of technology in life, in a way that is best fit to let you use it to its peak potential, increase your productivity, and most of all, protect your independence and freedom, not only from other people but from technology and its addicting design itself. It's an endless journey, one I still feel I'm just starting out on, but the thrill of helping others find the path is quite enjoyable.

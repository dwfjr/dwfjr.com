# Security Policy

## Reaching out to me

All emails sent to me are stored securely on ProtonMail's Swiss servers, for more information about ProtonMail and all the great work that they do, hop on over to their website at [ProtonMail](protonmail.com). If you want your message E2E (end-to-end) encrypted within their platform you can sign up for a free account at their site and shoot me an email. You'll get a little purple padlock telling you that you are emailing another ProtonMail user. I will have a whole section on this and how I can support you in the future.

## Where I stand

I want to help you find and create your technological independence and freedom, and that starts right here at www.dwfjr.com.
This is my personal website that contains everything from resources I think would be helpful tools to you, how to get in touch with me, and my background and digital resume.
You, are my guest, and my goal is to treat you like a guest. With this in mind I want to treat your data the same way I would want mine to be treated. That's why I'm building this website this way, from scratch and publicly on GitHub, there are no built in analytical tools like Google that many hosting platforms like WordPress have built in. This entire site is a tool for you to find new information, and reach out to me if you have questions or are interested in learning more about how I can help you build your own tailored digital lifestyle.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

_Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to help me improve this website to be the best tool for others and myself that it can be!_

If you are reading this you probably have something for me to hear! I will be the first to admit that I'm new to the web design environment and in that light I would be happy to get feedback and input on whats working and whats not.
I strongly believe in constructive criticism so if you have something to critique and help me improve please be my guest.
The best type of feedback I can get looks like this:
Issue
Risk
Possible Solutions
And most importantly to me, resources I can review or people I can talk to to learn more!

These can be submitted via an email to support@dwfjr.com or via GitHub issues, whichever you are more comfortable and familiar with.
Please be sure to note in the subject that this is a security related issue, I will work to get back to you within 48 hours if so marked.
Thank you!
